# nixos-config

A Git repository for my Nix configurations

## Design

This repository contains most of my Nix-related efforts, including
packages, systems and custom nixos modules.

## Points of Interest

Casual observers might find the following files to be of interest:

* `Justfile` :: Task-runner file containing some commonly used actions
* `pkgs/default.nix` :: Some interesting packages
* `modules/meshify.nix` :: Automatic mesh network based on nebula
* `modules/backup.nix` :: Easy to use backup module based on restic

## Continuous Integration

All packages in `pkgs` are evaluated and built by Hercules CI.
The results can be viewed [here](https://hercules-ci.com/github/leotaku/nixos-config).

In the future it might be possible to also perform CI on full systems.
